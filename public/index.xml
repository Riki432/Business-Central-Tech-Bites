My name is Rahul Bansode and for the past I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a Techno-Functional Consultant.
I have completed my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s from Mumbai University and a short course regarding ERP and Business Central which was the launch pad for me, in this field.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a passion for programming and problem solving and as such have a varied interest in reading about cryptography, cyber security, DSA and so on.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://tech-bites.netlify.app/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tech-bites.netlify.app/contact/</guid><description>Hey there!!
