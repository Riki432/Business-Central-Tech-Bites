method of modifying our data from within Excel using Web Services commonly found in the Edit in Excel action This can be seen in the commonly used List Pages for example Payment Terms However this functionality can be missing for certain pages or you might want to have additional logic or filtering before executing this For this Ill be demonstrating how to add the Edit in Excel action in Business Central pages ImagecontentimagesbusinesscentraladdingeditinexcelforcustomlistpartsImage1png Prerequisites Business Central Cloud References Viewing and Editting in Excel Microsoft Docshttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusdynamicsnavusingfilterexpressionsinodatauris Configuration ImagecontentimagesbusinesscentraladdingeditinexcelforcustomlistpartsImage2png In the above piece of code Ive added the Edit in Excel action onto the Blanket Sales Order SubForm to allow for easily adding lines using Excel Firstly we define the filters that we will be using on the page that we will be passing in the EditWorksheetInExcel procedure of the OdataUtility codeunit Note that these filters are defined as Odata expressions as the Edit in Excel functionality uses Excel behind the scenes In the next lines we see that we pass the Page Caption the page ID and the filters to be set on the page Under the hood the procedure creates a Published Web Service using the provided Page ID and uses that for the data manipulation We had to prepend the additional 00000 as the procedure has been hardcoded to use COPYSTR00000 PageID 5 meaning it starts reading after the 5th character Conclusion Thus we saw how to configure Edit in Excel for pages that do not have built in Excel functionality Also note that Microsoft has expanding the Edit in Excel functionality to many pages in Business Central since v19 Wave 2 but this can still be handy Happy Coding"},{"title":"Apply Multiple Entries to Each Other","tags":["Business

Customer with the open Payments for the said customer I observed that there was no quick and easy method to post the application directly This can be very useful in environments where Payment Entries are created via Integrations without specifying the invoice it needs to be applied to I read around online but couldnt find any blogs with the latest method of doing so in Business Central As such I spent a good portion of my day debugging the process of applying entries from start to end as written by Microsoft and to save your time Im going to jot down my findings here Prerequisites Business Central OnPremCloud Configuration ImagecontentimagesbusinesscentralapplymultipleentriestoeachotherImage1png Here as an example Im using a processing report to iterate over all the open Payments in the

Cleanup","tags":["Business Central"],"href":"/posts/business-central/automated-detached-media-cleanup","content":" Introduction In Business Central there are two ways to store files Either as Blobs or as Media types In Media types we store the files in the database Tenant Media ID 2000000184 and then we refer this record in other tables Whenever there are no records referring a Media it is deleted from the database Media types are much more performant as they support caching whereas BLOBs needs to be fetched from the SQL Server every time they are used Microsoft has moved most of the fields from using Blobs to Media types However in scenarios with a high load of writes and deletes it is possible that there may end up orphaned media records ie Media records that are not referenced anywhere In order to tackle such cases Microsoft has recently announced the FindOrphans procedure which would return a list of GUIDs of such orphaned Media Types which could then we dealt with as needed Theres also another tool that has been provided by Microsoft which uses this newly added procedures and helps us in reduce storage usage needlessly which is what are going to discuss today

Docshttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusdynamics365businesscentraldevitproadministrationoptimizesqldataaccess Select Latest Version Microsoft Docshttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusdynamics365businesscentraldevitprodevelopermethodsautodatabasedatabaseselectlatestversionmethod Explanation Caching is one of the methods which systems use to improve performance and respond to requests rapidly In a Business Central system caching is done at two levels 1 Business Central Server Instance Data Cache 2 SQL Server Data Cache Whenever a User requests data from Business Central it firsts check whether 1 The data is available in the Server Instances cache 2 If not then it checks the SQL Server Data Cache 3 And if not here then it fetches the data from the database The Business Central Server Instances Cache is accessible to all the Users connected to that Server Instance There are two types of cache stored here 1 Global Cache 2 Private Cache Global cache is the one which is accessible to all the Users connected to the SQL Server Private cache is only accessible over a transaction for a particular User for a particular company This cache is cleared as soon as the transaction is completed Which cache is to be used for which User depends on whether the Table from which the User is requesting data is locked or not In case it is locked Private Cache is queried else Global Cache is queried The following procedures in Business Central support using Cache 1 GET 2 GETBYSYSTEMID 3 FIND 4 FINDFIRST 5 FINDLAST 6 FINDSET 7 COUNT 8 ISEMPTY 9 CALCFIELDS Whenever we make a call to the FIND functions 1024 records are cached The Data Cache size in Business Central can be changed using the Data Cache Size setting of the Business Central Server Configuration file The default value is set to 9 which is equivalent to 500mb Increasing the value by 1 doubles the cache size ImagecontentimagesbusinesscentralcachinginbusinesscentralImage1png If we want to latest data from the database to be fetched ie if we want to bypass the cache we can use the SelectLatestVersion procedure ImagecontentimagesbusinesscentralcachinginbusinesscentralImage2png Just another note the results from Query objects in Business Central are not cached If there are multiple Server Instances over a single database Business Central synchronizes the cache every 30 seconds by default We can change this by using the CacheSynchronizationPeriod parameter in the CustomSettingsconfig file Conclusion Thus we saw how to Caching works in Business Central and how we can optimize it usage for maximum performance in Business Central Happy Coding"},{"title":"Changed Date Now Unable to Login to BC","tags":["Business

there were no errors in the Event Viewer that explicitly mention that it is a Date related issue The way I stumbled across it being a date related issue is that in the Response that the Business Central server sent to the Login Request was carrying the wrong date in it When I switched the System Date back to the date mentioned in the Response headers everything seemed to be working again Problem VerifiedcontentimagesbusinesscentralchangeddatenowunabletologintoBCImage1png Solution This issue is caused because when the system date is changed the same is changed in IIS but when you change it back IIS does not refresh it and we have to manually reset it Restarting it does not work trust me I tried One way to do this is to execute the following commands on the Server 1 net http stop 2 net http start These commands took a lot of time so be sure to have available down time before you run them The other way which is much simpler in my opinion is to simply restart the Server This stops all the services and restarts them which forces the IIS to reset as well SolutioncontentimagesbusinesscentralchangeddatenowunabletologintoBCImage2png Conclusion Thus in this blog we saw how

access to different features or objects We can use Permission Sets to prevent User access to specific objects like reports or pages For more refined rowlevel authorization we can use Security Filters to restrict access to individual record based on some filters Prerequisites Business Central OnCloud or OnPremise References Security Filters Microsoft Documentationhttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusdynamics365businesscentraldevitprosecuritysecurityfilters Configuration Suppose you want the User to only be able to access a specific set of Customers You can either create your own Permission Set from scratch in which you will describe all the objects that the User will have access to or you can copy one of the existing ones by clicking on Copy Permission Set and then entering a new name for the permission set Do note that you require proper permissions to make changes to Permission Sets as well Open the Permission Set by clicking on the Permissions

Thus we saw how to create and configure security filters in Business Central for maintaining record level security As a side note I would like to highlight that in Business Central in case a User has multiple Permission Sets containing different levels of permissions for the same object then Business Central combines these Permission Sets and uses the least restrictive group of Permissions As such if you apply a Permission Set with a Security Filter and another Permission Set without the filter on the same object Business Central will use the one without the Security Filter as it is least restrictive Happy Coding"},{"title":"Using Task Scheduler in Business Central","tags":["Business Central"],"href":"/posts/business-central/using-task-scheduler-in-business-central","content":" Introduction In Business Central we can use Task Schedulers to use background processing to ensure that Users are not bothered with long operations Task Scheduler provides us an easy to use and

you do not need to set this field 3 FromTable IDTo Table ID These fields specify the IDs of the tables In most cases these will be same only exception would be when you want to send data to custom Tables from BCLS Tables 4 Replication Method It has two options Normal In this method the entire table is transferred but as this is an expensive operation and unsustainable if the data in the table is growing constantly there is another field Replication Counter which resides on the table which is to be transferred it must be an integer field and every operation which modifiesinserts a record in the table this replication counter field must be updated Majority of tables provided by LS have a Replication Counter field in them By Actions Every operation we perform on every table is logged into a Preactions table by LS Then these Preactions are converted into Actions which are then used to transfer data 5 Field Transfer Type It specifies how to handle the fields of the table It has three options All All the fields from the From Table are transferred in the To Table Include List Only the fields specified are transferred Exclude All field except the ones specified are transferred 6 What to do It specifies the operations the transfer can perform There are the basic operations Add Update Delete and then building on them there are combinations of these operations Note Please use the delete operations carefully as it may cause unintended data deletion For most uses UpdateAdd is sufficient Replication ImagecontentimageslscentralconfiguringdatareplicationusingdatadirectorandscheduledjobsinLSpart2Image2png 1 Action Table ID This field is automatically updated when Replication Method is set to By Actions 2 Move Actions Specifies whether Actions should be transferred along with Data 3 Use Truncate When using Normal replication method if this is set to true then the destination table is cleared and then new data is inserted in it from the source table If you are using UpdateAddDelete as What to do then this is more efficient 4 Replication Counter Specifies which Integer field is to be used as the Replication Counter 5 Repl Counter Interval If this value is set then the data to be transferred is divided into blocks The size of the block is as defined in the field For instance as per the replication counter 1000 records are to be transferred But since sending a huge amount of data at once may burden the replicator we can specify the Repl Counter Interval at 100 after which the Subjob will run 10 times replicating 100 records at a time 6 Update Repl Counter Specifies whether the Replication Counter field in the destination table should be updated or not 7 Mark Sent Records In this field we can set a boolean field of the Source Table which will automatically be set to true when the record is set Please do note that none of the fields mentioned in the Replication tab are compulsory but creating a subjob without using the available replication options may become slower and network intensive as entire tables are transferred Transfer Field List ImagecontentimageslscentralconfiguringdatareplicationusingdatadirectorandscheduledjobsinLSpart2Image3png Go to Navigate Subjob Transfer Field List Here we specify the field mapping between the source and destination tables It also allows for some degree of Conversion in transferring for instance Set Conversion Type to Constant and set a value in the Conversion String field then after transferring the value specified in the Conversion String is set on all the records in the specified field Make sure the field is of type Text or Code before using this Another practical example would be When transferring User table if we simply send the password directly then the proper values are not transferred This can be resolved by using Skip Text Conv on the Password field before transferring From

Receipt in LS Central","tags":["LS Central"],"href":"/posts/ls-central/customizing-POS-receipt-in-ls-central","content":" Introduction POS Receipts are generated after every transaction that occurs on POS The default receipt provided by LS Central is generally sufficient but as is in all things there are always exceptions There are two methods that we can modify the POS Receipts and we are going to see them both Prerequisites Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central LS Central Configuration ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage1png This is the default receipt provided by LS I have marked division of sections using color Red Header Green Body Blue Footer Without going with customization we can still make some degree of changes to the standard layouts 1 Using Receipt Printing from POS Terminal Store Card We can add text directly into the Header or the Footer of the POS Receipts and also define some basic properties like bold italic or wide for the text It can be defined at POS Level or Store Level ie for individual POS Terminals or for all the POS Terminals in a Store Go to POS Terminal Card Go to Printing Receipt Printing ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage2png ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage3png Here you add static content like Store Name GSTVAT No Store Address etc in both header and footer Here you can also define if you want to specify the Item No or Barcode in the POS Receipt Similar to this we can also define for Store level ie all the POS Terminals in a Store ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage4png ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage5png 2 Using the POS Print Utility procedure Customization In this method we will write actual code to modify the receipt If you are using NAV then this is pretty straight forward but in case of Business Central we only have access to Events which we can subscribe to to change the behaviour of the procedure ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage6png The highlighted four procedures do the majority of the work done in printing PrintHeader Prints the content of the header defined in the Receipt Printing ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage7png PrintSubHeader It prints the Information related to the current Transaction ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage8png PrintSalesInfo It prints the actual Items of the Transaction along with VAT and other details ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage9png PrintFooter It prints the Footer Text defined in the Receipt Printing ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage10png Now that we know which procedure is responsible for which part of the Receipt we can subscribe to that procedures event For example lets try me modify the Sub Header part of the Receipt As such we need to modify the PrintSubHeader procedure so we subscribe to its event ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage11png The parameter sender gives us a reference to the current instance of POS Print Utility which we can use to call all the procedures of that codeunit with the proper values TransactionHeader is the current Transaction Header record At the start of the procedure we need to set the IsHandled variable to True so that once your procedure ends the main PrintSubHeader procedure exits immediately ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage12png DSTR It is the design String here we define the design of the Line that will be printed It is at max up to 40 characters It follows the pattern alignment The Design String is divided into sections each section contains one piece of data Value It is a text array which defines the data which is to be printed in the sections The number of values set in the Value should be equal to the sections in the design string Node It is used as a Label for the data in the section The number of values in this array should be the same as the values in Value array Next the essential part is the FormatStr procedure the 4 booleans at the end are used to specify whether the String is going to be Wide Bold High or Italic respectively After this the final piece of the puzzle is the AddPrintLine procedure the first argument is the Section ID it is related to which part of the receipt we are printing in it is better to set it the same as the procedure that we are customizing Next argument specifies the maximum number of Sections that will be in the design string just make sure it is more than the values you have provided Next we pass the Node and Value array the Design String and specify whether the String is going to be Wide Bold High or Italic and the Tray at the end The value for Tray can be taken directly from the Events parameters Similar to this we will add one more line and then we will check the results ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage13png The PrintSeperator procedure is used to draw a horizontal line across the receipt using dashes Here is the final result ImagecontentimageslscentralcustomizingPOSreceiptinlscentralImage14png Conclusion Thus we saw how to customize POS Receipts in LS Central either through POSStore Receipt Printing or for advanced customizations through Event subscriptions Happy Coding"},{"title":"POS Data Tables","tags":["LS Central"],"href":"/posts/ls-central/pos-data-tables","content":" Introduction POS Data Tables are used

Services or APIs we often use POSTMAN for testing the request and the responses Today well see how we can automate this testing to a certain extent using the inbuilt features of POSTMAN We can have testing logic that runs before every request after every request or logic that tests on particular request In the below demonstration well write automated test to check for GET PUT POST and DELETE operations for a single record on a custom API Postman itself provides a bunch of standard procedures or boiler plate code which we can modify as per our requirements As this uses Javascript we can also use additional JS features here Prerequisites Account in Postmanhttpswwwpostmancomdownloads Business Central OnCloudOnPrem Configuration 1 POST Request So first we are going to be creating a record in the Customer Table with the following fields ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage1png One of the common things to be testing with Custom APIs is to verify whether the request is being created successfully 1 and what we are sending and what is being stored in the record are the same2 As we are using Javascript the response is stored in the jsonData variable and we can access any of the fields of the response as a property on the jsonData variable ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage2png As the rest of our automated tests are doing to be performed on this same record we need to store the Identifier for this record inside some variable which exists outside the scope of this request here we are using a variable with the Collection scope If you want to use the same variable outside of this collection you can also define Global variables ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage3png 2 GET Request In a simple GET request the only thing we are concerned with here is whether the request is executed successfully or not For this we are simply going to be checking the Status Code ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage4png 3 PUT Request In a PUT request we are going to be modifying the record that we previously created here Im going to update the name of the record ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage5png A common testcase for PUT requests would be to ensure that a the request is completed successfully and b what is being sent in the request is what is updated on the record and is available in the response ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage6png 4 DELETE Request In a simple DELETE request the only thing we are concerned with is whether the requested is executed successfully and here we will be simply checking the Status Code returned ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage7png 5 Once all the Automated Tests are written you can either execute them from the Collection Level or from a folder level Here we will be executing our tests from the folder level ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage8png 6 We can also define the Run Order for the requests ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage9png 7 Once the Tests have run we can get a summary of the results as well as detailed version of the results ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage10png ImagecontentimagestoolsusingpostmanforautomatedtestingImage11png Conclusion Thus we saw how to use Automated Testing in POSTMAN to reduce rework and increase efficiency while testing A bonus tip you can now use POSTMAN Web Version to create requests instead of download the POSTMAN app and the entire blog above was written using the Web App of POSTMAN Do note that not everything that can be done on the Windows App can be done on the Web App Happy Coding"}]
