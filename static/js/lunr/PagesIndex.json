Date Now Unable to Login to BC","tags":["Business Central","Technical","Functional"],"href":"/posts/business-central/changed-date-now-unable-to-login-to-BC","content":" Introduction While doing some customization testing which revolved around using different dates I realized that once the date is switched back to the correct date I was unable to connect to Business Central I restarted the server instance IIS SQL Server services to no avail Prerequisites Business Central OnPrem with SSL Setup References Server Faulthttpsserverfaultcomquestions217343dateheaderreturnedbyiis7iswrong Microsoft Supporthttpssupportmicrosoftcomenustopicusingnetstopandnetstartcommandstoforceiisservicestorereadtheregistryc6fe0d0b989336d0cc3c47d03f9ccdde Verification Logging into Business Central gave no errors there were no errors in the Event Viewer that explicitly mention that it is a Date related issue The way I stumbled across it being a date related issue is that in the Response that the Business Central server sent to the Login Request was carrying the wrong date in it When I switched the System Date back to the date mentioned in the Response headers everything seemed to be working again Problem VerifiedhttpsiibbcoY7bLcPXimagepng Solution This issue is caused because when the system date is changed the same is changed in IIS but when you change it back IIS does not refresh it and we have to manually reset it Restarting it does not work trust me I tried One way to do this is to execute the following commands on the Server 1 net http stop 2 net http start These commands took a lot of time so be sure to have available down time before you run them The other way which is much simpler in my opinion is to simply restart the Server This stops all the services and restarts them which forces the IIS to reset as well SolutionhttpsiibbcomJ4K1zkimagepng Conclusion Thus in this blog we saw how to resolve the issue of being unable to login after change Server Date in Business Central Hope this helps"},{"title":"Working with Odata Bound Actions","tags":["Business Central","Technical"],"href":"/posts/business-central/odata-bound-actions","content":" Introduction OData Bound Actions allows us to perform logic in Business Central by hitting specific end points We can also pass in parameters and get results in response Its very similar to using Azure Functions but is natively built into Business Central at no extra cost In this example well be returns the Base64 version of an Image of a Customer we will also see how to get the Image for any other customer as well Prerequisites 1 Business Central OnPremOnCloud References WebServiceActionContext httpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusdynamics365businesscentraldevitprodevelopermethodsautowebserviceactioncontextwebserviceactioncontextdatatype Interacting with Odatav4 bound actionshttpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusdynamics365businesscentraldevitprodeveloperdevenvcreatingandinteractingwithodatav4boundaction Configuration OData Bound Actions are written on Pages or API Pages that you are declaring as Web Services In this example below Ive created a simple Customer Page with a few fields and kept the OData key field as the No field Ive also defined this as a Web Service in Business Central Image 1httpsiibbcoBPKLYVDimage8png To create a OData Bound Action we create a Global Procedure with the Service Enabled decorator In this procedure we have to create a WebServiceActionContext variable and set the ObjectType ObjectID and Keys that we are using for this Web Service which is No in this case after our processing is done we also need to set the Result Code for this request Image 2httpsiibbconP8yNFBimage7png In the above piece of code Ive written simple logic which converts the content of a Media Data Type Image field to Base64 Text and returns it In PostMan if you check of the metadata youll be able to see this action defined in the metadata Image 3httpsiibbcob7wyY7timage111024x551png Now its time to test out OData Bound Action To call the OData Bound Action we need to be working with a single record So we specify the No field to identify a single record Image 4httpsiibbco8X35sCNimage121024x522png Now we append our procedure name as NAVProcedure Name and make a POST request Image 5httpsiibbcoBBKcskVimagepng If we put this Base64 through a Base64 to File Converter we can see that the original data is recovered Image 6httpsiibbcovVq7XGfimagepng Now we create a new procedure which will take the System ID as a parameter and return the Image data for that Customer Record Image 7httpsiibbcoyW52MLWimagepng Image 8httpsiibbcoxsMBNPBimagepng If you want to pass the parameters to the OData Bound Actions you have to do it as the Body of the Request Image 9httpsiibbcoB3NzmBkimagepng Conclusion PS Ive tried but it seems polymorphism doesnt work with this I hope this was insightful and a quick start on how to write OData Bound Actions Happy coding"},{"title":"Report Does Not Have a Layout Type

Questionhttpscommunitydynamicscombusinessbthinkaboutitpostshowdoifixerrorreportxdoesnothavealayoutoftypenone Configuration With the earlier versions of Business Central you were allowed to run a report without specifying a layout even if it was not a processing only report However with the recent version of Business Central it is mandatory to specify both the DefaultLayout and the path to the layout via the RDLCLayout or WordLayout or ExcelLayout properties Once these properties are the defined the error is resolved Furthermore you can also resolve this error by using the report rendering section which has been made available since runtime 90 However be sure to define the DefaultRenderingLayout property for the report to specify which of the layouts defined should be considered as

Command to remove all the lines from the current transaction Prerequisites Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central On Premise LS Central V16 Configuration You will need a Codeunit in which we define all the custom commands all your Custom commands can be added in a single Codeunit Make sure to set the TableNo property to POS Menu Line table In the OnRun trigger we have to handle two cases 1 Registering the module and other commands 2 Procedure to execute when command is called For handling the first case we create a procedure Register which takes a POS Menu Line as a parameter In this procedure we use the POS Command Registration codeunit to register this module and all the associated commands Image 1httpsiibbcowYgY1GHimagepng I prefer to use Global Labels to store the Module Code Module Description and Command CodeCommand Description as this change in once place need not be replicated everywhere this way but it is not necessary Image 2httpsiibbcoHHLVDFnimagepng Once this is
