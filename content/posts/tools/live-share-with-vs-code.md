# Introduction
VS Code has a feature, Live Share, using which multiple people can access the same workspace in VS Code and modify files at the same time. 

This has huge applications in teaching, code reviews as well as prototyping. 

You can edit modify separate files at the same time in the same folder.

## Pre-requisites
