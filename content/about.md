# Hey!

My name is Rahul Bansode and for the past 2 years, I've been working as a Techno-Functional Consultant.

I have completed my Bachelor's from Mumbai University and a short course regarding ERP and Business Central which was the launch pad for me, in this field.

I've always had a passion for programming and problem solving and as such have a varied interest in reading about cryptography, cyber security, DSA and so on.

I'm a Microsoft Certified Trainer and I've also completed the MB-800 Business Central Functional consultant exam on September 2021.

In my current employment, I've helped streamline development practices and developed tools to ensure code consistency and easy of understanding for any new team member joining the project.

I hope to continue gaining experience and expertise across different Microsoft Products in the Cloud and as such am actively trying to learn more about them as well.
